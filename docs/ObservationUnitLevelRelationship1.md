# openapi::ObservationUnitLevelRelationship1

Observation levels indicate the granularity level at which the measurements are taken.   `levelName` defines the level   `levelOrder` defines where that level exists in the hierarchy of levels. `levelOrder`s lower numbers are at the top of the hierarchy (ie field > 0) and higher numbers are at the bottom of the hierarchy (ie plant > 6).   `levelCode` is an ID code for this level tag. Identify this observation unit by each level of the hierarchy where it exists
