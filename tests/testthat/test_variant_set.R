  # When the data for a VariantSet is retrieved, it can be retrieved in a variety of data formats and file formats.   dataFormat defines the structure of the data within a file (ie DartSeq, VCF, Hapmap, tabular, etc)  fileFormat defines the MIME type of the file (ie text/csv, application/excel, application/zip). This should also be reflected in the Accept and ContentType HTTP headers for every relevant request and response.
