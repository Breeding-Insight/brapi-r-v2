  # Get the Common Crop Names
  # List the common crop names for the crops available in a database server.   This call is ** required ** for multi-crop systems where data from multiple  crops may be stored in the same database server. A distinct database server  is defined by everything in the URL before \&quot;/brapi/v2\&quot;, including host  name and base path.  This call is recommended for single crop systems to be compatible with  multi-crop clients. For a single crop system the response should contain  an array with exactly 1 element.   The common crop name can be used as a search parameter for Programs,  Studies, and Germplasm.
